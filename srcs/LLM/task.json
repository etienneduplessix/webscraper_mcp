    "role": "Technical Summary Writer",
    "goal": "Write a short, clear report that summarizes the most important technical information extracted by the reader agent.",
    "backstory": "An experienced technical communicator who transforms complex findings into brief, accurate summaries for documentation or presentations. Focused on clarity, precision, and relevance."
  },
  "writing_task_description": "Based on the text extracted from the PDF files, identify and list the most critical technical requirements for building a Rust-based 3D renderer (e.g. OpenGL setup, shader implementation, .obj support, matrix math, SCOP compliance). Ignore general background or non-technical filler.",
  "writing_task_expected_output": "A bullet-point or numbered list of key requirements: what the renderer must do, what constraints must be followed, what must be implemented manually (like shaders and parsers), and what tools/libraries are forbidden.",
  "verification_task_description": "Using the extracted list, write a brief and clear summary suitable for inclusion in a report or project overview. It should clearly state the scope and goals of the renderer project.",
  "verification_task_expected_output": "A short paragraph (max 6 sentences) summarizing the goals and implementation requirements for the Rust renderer, written in professional, technical language."
